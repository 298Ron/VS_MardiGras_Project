                <h2>About Mardi Gras</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="about_first_p">
                    The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the
                    17th and 18th
                    centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras,"
                    or fatted calf,
                    followed France to her colonies.

                    On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a
                    plot of ground 60
                    miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it
                    was the eve of the
                    festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in
                    1702. In 1703, the
                    tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.

                    In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                    current Mardi Gras
                    krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711
                    through 1861. The
                    procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would
                    parade with an actual
                    bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.

                    New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in
                    New Orleans, but not
                    with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
                    established elegant
                    society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.

                    The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                    governing body. That
                    year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and
                    carnival organizations
                    formed in New Orleans.

                    By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback
                    riders to celebrate Mardi
                    Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each
                    event an exciting air
                    of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus,
                    invoking John Milton's
                    hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with
                    dazzling floats (known
                    as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.

                <div id="under_line_between_two_p"></div>
                <p class="about_second_p">In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed.
                    This is
                    also the first
                    recorded account of
                    Mardi Gras "throws."

                    Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition"
                    lithographs of
                    parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were always
                    carefully guarded before
                    the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details could not be clearly seen.
                    But beginning in 1886
                    with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be produced in full,
                    saturated color,
                    doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A.
                    Wikstrom. Each of these
                    designers' work was brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who
                    for 40 years was
                    responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.

                    1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the
                    first daytime
                    parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced
                    Romanoff's family colors of
                    purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for justice; gold for power; and
                    green for faith.
                    This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love,"
                    was cemented, due in
                    part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.

                    The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of France,
                    culminating with Comus'
                    magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic paper-mache' animal
                    costumes served as
                    the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry
                    Warmoth. In 1875,
                    Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which
                    it still is.

                    Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private
                    social clubs with
                    restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely funded by
                    their members, New
                    Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p>

            <h2>New Orleans Mayor</h2>
            <h3>LaToya Cantrell</h3>
            <p>Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                history.[28] Once
                in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic
                plan to address
                families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
                finding solutions to
                violent crime.[29] Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city
                use, Cantrell has
                focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public
                parks, and green
                spaces.[30] As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against
                four opioid
                manufacturers and distributors.[31]

                During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with
                Governor John
                Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding
                for the city's
                infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city.[32] Following the
                approval of the
                Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Cantrell and the City Council put
                on the ballot
                in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental
                properties, as
                well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.</p>
