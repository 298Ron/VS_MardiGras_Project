    <div class="faq_accordion">
        <button class="accordion">Do I need tickets?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>There is no need for tickets to see a parade...all of them are FREE!! That is why it is called "The
                Greatest Free Show
                on Earth!". You only get tickets if you want to sit down on stands as the parades pass.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Are Carnival and Mardi Gras the same thing?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6 (see question
                below) and ends
                on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when Lent begins. It is also
                common for
                people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat Tuesday "Mardi Gras
                Day." Locals tend
                to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the last two weekends leading up to Tuesday are"Mardi Gras."

        <button class="accordion">What is Twelfth Night?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Twelfth Night (aka, Twelfth Night, the Feast of the Epiphany, the Epiphany Eve and Three Kings' Day) is
                celebrated on
                January 6th. It is considered the last day of Christmas festivities around the world (when Christmas
                decorations come
                down). Shakespeare named one of his romantic comedies after this Christian holiday that takes place on
                the last day of
                the twelfth day of Christmas. Here in New Orleans, January 6th is the official start of the Carnival
                season every year
                with the first parades rolling on this day. It is also considered the beginning of king cake season.
                While the date of
                Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) changes, Twelfth Night does not. According to Wikipedia, different traditions
                mark the date of
                Twelfth Night as either January 5 or January 6 (it depends on whether they start counting the twelve
                days on December 25
                or 26).</p>

        <button class="accordion">When was the first Mardi Gras?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They began
                the tradition of
                presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and their guests.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Why are masks worn?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for everyone else, and
                the elaborate
                masks that some wear add to the fun.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">How is a king chosen?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random drawings, while others
                invite a
                celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by the School of Design, who
                sponsors the Rex
                parade. His identity is revealed the day before the parade.</p>

        <button class="accordion">How long have "throws" been around?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The tradition of float riders throwing trinkets to the crowds began in the 1870s, and continues today.
                Typical throws
                include beads, cups, doubloons and stuffed animals.</p>
